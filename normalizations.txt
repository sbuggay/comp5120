~~Normalizations~~

A lot of the designs were done in such a way that it would already be BCNF.  Though we did have to brake apart room in the normalization process when we realized it wasn't working initially

Room
RoomID->roomName,roomCost,numBeds
roomName->roomCost,numBeds

Broke apart to be:

RoomCost
roomName->roomCost,numBeds
BCNF

Room
RoomID->roomName
BCNF

------------------------

Doctor
DoctorID->Name,Phone,Office

Bed
roomID,bedLabel -> roomID,bedLabel (Trivial)

Insurance
InsuranceName->Phone

Patient
PatientID->name,addrStreet,addrCity,addrState,addrZIP,admitted,discharged,doctorID,insuranceName,policyNum,roomID,bedLabel
addrZip->addrCity

Decided not to brake this apart because we will not use zip to determine city.  If we were going to then we wouldn't store city

TreatmentType
TreatmentType->Cost,Ordered

Treatment
TreatmentID->TreatmentType,doctorID,patientID,duration

TreatmentInvolvement
TreatmentID,EmployeeType->Count
